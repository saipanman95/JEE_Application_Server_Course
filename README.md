# JEE Application Server Course – Practice Files

This repository contains the complete set of practice files that support the **Java Enterprise Edition (JEE) Application Server Course** you delivered on LinkedIn Learning.

## What’s inside  
- Sample web-application projects that you can deploy to multiple enterprise-grade application servers:
  - Apache Tomcat  
  - Oracle WebLogic Server  
  - JBoss WildFly (previously JBoss AS)  
  - Payara Server (an open-source fork of GlassFish)  

## Why this matters  
Enterprise Java environments vary significantly in deployment, configuration, and runtime behavior. By working through the included projects, you’ll gain hands-on experience with:
- Packaging and deploying EAR/WAR modules  
- Configuring data sources, JMS, JNDI, and clustered environments  
- Managing server-specific settings, class-loading, and resource scopes  
- Debugging deployment issues across different app-servers  

## Getting started  
1. Clone or download the repository.  
2. Open the sample project in your preferred IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse).  
3. Choose the target application server of your choice.  
4. Follow the “README-[server]” file (or folder) for that server to configure and deploy the sample app.  
5. Explore variations: change datasource configs, tweak web.xml/EJB-jar descriptors, scale out to clusters, etc.
